		<p class="p4">Here is the <a href="http://www.davincischools.org/faculty/noel-ingram/"target="_blank">Humanities 10</a> page for Project 2. In this class, I chose a photo from the Industrial Revolution based of off Child Labor. I had to do a poem and a collage that reflected off the image. Lastly, there was an Artistic Written Statement that I was assigned to do in which we had to talk about the choices that I made in both my poem and collage. I chose another topic to do another poem and collage which was based on Social Media and Family.There was also a Artistic Written Statement connected to it. Everything is listed below.</p>

My poem was based off of child labor and so I also put some of my lines from my poem in the young girl's perspective which was in my photo.
