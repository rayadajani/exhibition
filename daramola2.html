		<p class="p4">Here is the <a href="http://www.davincischools.org/faculty/andrew-daramola/"target="_blank">World History</a> page for Project 2. In this class, we learned about the Industrial Revolution and so we were divided into groups, so my group got an object from the Industrial Revolution which played an important role and that was the thresher machine. We were assigned to make a sketch of it and make it a replica of it. To go along with this for our presentation we had to do press release slides. All these things are located below.

			<p class="p2">Above is a photo of the thresher machine which was sketched by my peer William Webster. This was a prototype of a thresher machine that was powered by horses. Click on the photo to see it fully and in a different tab.</p>

			<p class="p2">On top, is the replica of the thresher machine which was sketched on the left. My group mates and I built the thresher machine out of different parts such as wooden blocks, wooden sticks, wooden wheels, and more. We used paint and fake grass that we used in our display to make it look more appealing. Click on the photo above to see it clearly in a new tab. </p>

		<div class="box 3"><p class="p3">Press Release</p>
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h5fb_bD8ZcHhJf60sg0bEsyFdBoAmx5febrQv-EM_50/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank"><img src="images/pressslide.PNG" width="430" height="340"/></a>
			<p class="p2">This is a picture of the introduction slide for the press release slides on the thresher machine. My group and I needed to try to sell our product which was the thresher machine and so in these slides we talked about the historical significance, the inventor of the first thresher machine, benefits of it on the Industrial Revolution, and more in order to encourage the audience to buy our product.</p>
